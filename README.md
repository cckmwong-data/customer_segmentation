# Customer Clustering and Sales Analytics

---
## Problem Statement

With rising competition and evolving customer expectations, insurers leverage data-driven intelligence to understand customer behavior and tailor their offerings accordingly. Customer segmentation provides a structured way to group individuals with shared characteristics, enabling more efficient targeting and marketing strategies.

---

## Project Summary

This project automates an end-to-end customer segmentation workflow, integrating raw data ingestion from **Google Sheets**, clustering analysis using **K-Prototypes** and **AI (Gemini)**, data warehousing in **Google BigQuery**, and daily refreshed **Power BI dashboards**. It is designed to deliver actionable insights for marketing and sales teams through a fully automated, cloud-based, and production-ready solution.

---
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `kmodes`, `gower`, `prince`, `sklearn`, `pandas-gbq`
- **Artificial Intelligence**: gemini-2.5-flash 
- **GitHub Actions**: automation of Python scripts
- **Google BigQuery**: SQL
- **Power BI**: real-time dashboards

---
## Highlights

- Fully automated from raw data to dashboard insights
- Real-world use of mixed-type clustering with K-Prototypes
- CI/CD-ready pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Cloud-native design using BigQuery + Power BI
- Business-friendly, scalable, and no manual refreshes required

## Workflow Overview

This is a project covering an automated end-to-end data pipeline which performs clustering, stores the output in a warehouse, and updates a [live dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNThiYjk5ZWQtZDcwYy00YWFhLWFlNjItNGI1OGNiNDE2Y2E1IiwidCI6IjZjMWQ0MTUyLTM5ZDAtNDRjYS04OGQ5LWI4ZDZkZGNhMDcwOCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D).

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting raw data from Google Sheets: [customers.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bzB4VDQEQz0BIbyT2BCIvcE2rPSAlOcmeQuvMtuIFcI/export?format=csv), [sales.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xrPtoy8R965CPSCS59_hcLP1cwzNcp7DJ2MOegZrsVA/export?format=csv), [products.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HpCKgERS0F9qjHh3y0_GZ988JjX4vtKBX5rIksCgB5I/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&gid=0)


2. **Data Processing (Extract-Transform-Load ETL)**  
- Data cleaning (e.g. checking any missing values or duplicates)
- Data wrangling and feature engineering to ensure the data is in the right format for K-Prototype clustering
- K-Prototypes clustering
- Segment labeling and description generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Loading the updated customers, sales and products tables to Google BigQuery
- Automation of the above process via GitHub Actions (daily at 10PM UK time) 
  
3. **Data Warehousing**: Processed model outputs were stored as tables in BigQuery for reporting and analysis, alongside views generated from SQL queries.

4. **Business Intelligence**: A [live dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNThiYjk5ZWQtZDcwYy00YWFhLWFlNjItNGI1OGNiNDE2Y2E1IiwidCI6IjZjMWQ0MTUyLTM5ZDAtNDRjYS04OGQ5LWI4ZDZkZGNhMDcwOCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D) in Microsoft Power BI shows an analysis of customer and sales data the company. Data is scheduled for an automatic update on a daily basis at 11PM UK time.
